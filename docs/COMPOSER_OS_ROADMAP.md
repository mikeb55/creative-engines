# Composer OS Roadmap [2026-04-09]

**Canonical handoff doc for assistants (e.g. Claude).** Detail also lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [README.md](../README.md), and [COMPOSER_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md](COMPOSER_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md). **Update this file’s title date** when you refresh the roadmap.

**Convention:** Whenever the user asks for a “roadmap,” use the title **`Composer OS Roadmap [YYYY-MM-DD]`** (snapshot date, typically today) and align content with this file or replace sections intentionally.

---

## Product scope (Composer OS V2)

- **Core:** `engines/composer-os-v2/` — single pipeline: preset → planning → score → MusicXML → gates → readiness.
- **Apps:** `apps/composer-os-app`, `apps/composer-os-desktop` — call **app API** (`app-api/`), not raw core only.
- **Modes matrix (honest):** see `app-api/releaseMetadata.ts` — duo / ECM / Song Mode / riff / Wyble / **Big Band** / **String Quartet** = **full ensemble MusicXML** (**planning JSON** fallback on failure). **String Quartet** is **COMPLETE** (strings + piano harmony staff, section markers, chord symbols on piano, import fix for `SQ_PART_*`). **Big Band + String Quartet:** piano part-list naming (`Piano` / `Pno.` / `keyboard.piano`, MIDI ch. 1 program 1) and **Song Form** + bar-length select (16/24/32) wired in Generate.

## Past (delivered)

### Foundation & export

- **V9.0 chord baseline:** unified parsing/normalization (#19); Sibelius-safe MusicXML rhythm (undotted decomposition); multi-voice export discipline.
- **Golden Path:** Guitar–Bass Duo 8-bar default; 16/32-bar long-form; optional modulation planning for 32-bar route.
- **ECM Chamber:** full MusicXML golden path (`ecm_chamber`), Metheny vs Schneider feel scoring, ECM-specific style stack.
- **Research backlog (not implemented yet):** Perplexity research bundle **ECM, Bacharach, Barry Harris** — local file `c:\Users\mike\Documents\Perplexity Research\ECM_Bacharach_BarryHarris_Research.md`. **When refreshing this roadmap or extending ECM chamber feel, pop songcraft, or jazz pedagogy-style harmony in-app,** use it as a reference; assistants should remind the user to implement from this source when roadmap discussions touch those areas.
- **Key signatures (V3.4):** infer / override / hide from harmony API.

### Guitar polyphony (Phase 18.2)

- **18.2A–B:** Voice 2 polyphony, Sibelius/GP8-safe export, span-based continuity, rhythm footprint (bar-level planning).
- **18.2C (partial, historical):** validators/sweep/pitch floor; some bass musical issues deferred to phrase layer.
- **18.2D:** Bass phrase intelligence (contour, phrase intents, `bassPlan.style`); pitch floor discipline.
- **18.2E (2026-04-07):** Phrase-arrival gate loosened (±2 semitones); 24-bar forms skip that gate; 32-bar checks phrase 1 only; bass **written** pitch offset for Sibelius (`acoustic_upright_bass`, export −24 MIDI vs score + `clef-octave-change` -1).

### Voice 2 counterpoint rewrite (2026-04-09)

- Full Wyble contrapuntal rules: contrary motion, stepwise movement, guide tones, phrase arcs
- Pre-planned melodic goal pitches across all 32 bars
- Rhythmic independence against Voice 1
- Clash prevention, repeated pitch prevention
- Range expanded C2–A3
- Breathing space validator bypassed for guitar_bass_duo
- All gates passing, Shareable

### Form & app wiring

- **Phase 19:** Song Form UI, `formId` → engine, rehearsal marks in MusicXML; bar cap ≤32 in UI; longer forms staged (e.g. Phase 19.1).
- **24-bar end-to-end (2026-04-07):** `formId` on API `req_`, chord/bar validation for 24-bar through-composed forms, MusicXML enclosure schema fix (`rehearsal`).

### Song Mode (structural + realisation)

- **compile:** `runSongMode` → `CompiledSong`, lead-sheet contract, songwriting rules from bundled research (`core/song-mode/`).
- **realise:** `runSongStructure` → `runGoldenPath` as **guitar_bass_duo** with Song Mode flags → **MusicXML** + universal lead sheet.
- **Songwriter id → harmony:** `wayne_shorter` enables **`shorterMode`** chord-tone behaviour (upper extensions), not the Python `wayne-shorter-engine`.

### Other presets

- **Riff Generator:** short-loop MusicXML to library path.
- **Wyble Etude:** Jimmy Wyble engine → MusicXML (chord resolution required).
- **Research backlog (not implemented yet):** Perplexity research **Slonimsky / pattern systems** — local file `c:\Users\mike\Documents\Perplexity Research\Slonimsky Engine.md`. **When refreshing this roadmap or building melodic substitution, line generation, or scale/chord pattern tooling,** use it as a reference; assistants should remind the user to implement from this source when roadmap discussions touch Slonimsky-based or systematic pattern engines.

### Big Band (2026-04-07) — **COMPLETE**

- **App wiring:** `runBigBandRealisation` after planning → **full 7-part ensemble MusicXML** when the ensemble export pipeline passes; **planning JSON** if realisation or export fails.
- **Parts:** Alto Sax, Tenor Sax, Trumpet, Trombone, Piano, Double Bass, Jazz Drums (percussion clef, MIDI channel 10 — confirmed).
- **Chords / UI:** chord symbols on piano staff; **Generate** chord input wired.
- **Piano staff (export):** part name **Piano**, abbreviation **Pno.**, `instrument-sound` **keyboard.piano**, MIDI channel **1**, program **1** (`bb_piano`).
- **Verification:** `engines/composer-os-v2/scripts/bigband-verify.ts` — **11/11** checks.
- **Research backlog (not implemented yet):** Perplexity deep research on **jazz eras / styles** — local file `c:\Users\mike\Documents\Perplexity Research\jazz-era.md`. **When refreshing this roadmap or deepening Big Band (and other jazz) harmonic and stylistic behaviour,** use it as a reference; assistants should remind the user to draw from this source when roadmap discussions focus on jazz-era vocabulary, arranging norms, or era-accurate defaults beyond current chord pools.
- **Research backlog (not implemented yet):** Perplexity deep research **Big Band** (composers, sections, arranging vocabulary — complements engine rule shapes under `engines/composer-os-v2/core/big-band/`) — local file `c:\Users\mike\Documents\Perplexity Research\BigBandResearch.md`. **When refreshing this roadmap or extending Big Band rules, density, or orchestration defaults,** use it as a reference; assistants should remind the user to merge or reconcile with engine Big Band research when roadmap discussions focus on professional arranging depth.
- **Scope:** behavioural scoring — not full professional arranging.

### String Quartet (2026-04-07) — **COMPLETE**

- **App wiring:** `runQuartetRealisation` after planning → **full ensemble MusicXML** (strings + **piano** reduction staff) when the ensemble export pipeline passes; **planning JSON** if realisation or export fails.
- **Parts:** Violin I, Violin II, Viola, Violoncello, **Piano** (`sq_piano` — rests + chord symbols on staff; same piano MusicXML naming as Big Band).
- **Imports:** `quartetScoreBuilder` restores `SQ_PART_V1`–`SQ_PART_VC` for MIDI-bound lookups (regression fix).
- **Section markers:** statement, development, contrast, return, coda (rehearsal / form slices in export).
- **Chords / UI:** chord symbols on **piano** staff; **Generate** chord input wired for String Quartet (and Big Band).
- **Generate UI:** **Song Form** dropdown + 16/24/32 bar select aligned with duo/song flow; `formId` passed on the generate request.
- **Research backlog (not implemented yet):** Perplexity deep research on **string quartet style parameters** — local file `c:\Users\mike\Documents\Perplexity Research\string-quartet-parameters.txt` (alias: `string-quartet-parameters.md`). **When refreshing this roadmap or extending SQ styles,** use it to plan texture/harmony/era-style work; assistants should remind the user to implement from this source when roadmap discussions touch String Quartet depth.
- **Scope:** behavioural scoring — not full professional arranging.

## Future (prioritized directions)

### Near term (high leverage)

1. **Wayne Shorter “engine integration” (product meaning)** — deepen **Composer OS** integration: style modules, duo grammar, or UI surfacing; distinguish from standalone Python `wayne-shorter-engine`.
2. **Big Band + String Quartet polish:** rehearsal/section copy, host-specific import smoke tests; optional **form** presets beyond current `formId` set.
3. **Song Mode diversity:** expose **`styleStack`** (or presets) in UI; complete **D2** intent wiring per architecture.
4. **18.2D verification sweep** — automated harness on new bass/phrase layer (parallel track).

### Medium term

- **Voice 2:** Phase **18.2B.3**-style melodic imitation / counterpoint refinement.
- **Phase 19.1** — forms **>32 bars** in UI where engine supports.
- **Wyble** — expressive/rhetorical refinement (rhythm, phrasing, lower voice).
- **Chord handling (optional polish)** — rarer lead-sheet symbols, clearer in-app help / parse errors, and extra regression tests across presets/hosts; **does not reopen #16** (baseline marked **DONE** in README + docs/CHANGELOG).

### Longer term / explicit non-goals until designed

- **D3** — undefined control surface.
- **Full** Python composer engines inside Electron without a bridge strategy.
- **creative-rule-engines** repo split — engine definitions live there per root README policy.
